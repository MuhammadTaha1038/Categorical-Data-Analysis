## Overview
Welcome to the **Working with Categorical Data in Python** project! This Jupyter Notebook is designed to help you understand and process categorical data efficiently. Whether you're working on data preprocessing, feature engineering, or visualization, this notebook provides clear explanations and hands-on implementations using Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, and Matplotlib.

I created this notebook to serve as a practical guide for handling categorical variables, ensuring that data scientists and analysts can make informed decisions when working with real-world datasets.

## Features
- Comprehensive introduction to categorical data
- Various encoding techniques:
  - One-Hot Encoding
  - Label Encoding
  - Ordinal Encoding
- Handling missing categorical data effectively
- Optimizing memory usage for categorical variables
- Data visualization techniques:
  - Count Plots
  - Pie Charts
  - Bar Charts
- Real-world dataset demonstrations

## Installation
To get started, install the required dependencies using:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn
```

## Usage
1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone <https://github.com/MuhammadTaha1038/Categorical-Data-Analysis.git>
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd <Categorical-Data-Analysis>
```
3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook Categorical_Data.ipynb
```
4. Follow the structured notebook to learn and apply categorical data techniques.

## Datasets Used
This notebook works with multiple real-world datasets:
- **Adult Income Dataset** - Demographic and income-related attributes.
- **Shelter Dogs Dataset** - Data on dog breeds and adoption status.
- **Las Vegas TripAdvisor Dataset** - Hotel reviews and ratings.
- **Cars Dataset** - Specifications of different car brands, including fuel types.

Make sure these datasets are available in the correct directory before running the notebook.

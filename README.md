# Categorical-Data-Analysis
This project explores handling categorical data in Python, covering encoding techniques like One-Hot, Label, and Ordinal Encoding. It also addresses missing values, memory optimization, and visualization. Practical examples use real-world datasets, including the Adult Income, Shelter Dogs, Las Vegas TripAdvisor, and Cars datasets.
